Example using GNU parallel to simultaneously run multiple commands on the same GPU.

The PBS job script submit.pbs runs 10 python scripts at the same time for a total of 100 scripts.

Modify the file "submit.pbs" to change how many commands run at the same time.
Modify the file "commands" to change the list of commands to be run (or adapt "submit.pbs" with suitable syntax for parallel command)
Modify the file "launch" to change how the individual commands are run in Docker containers.

Will only work correctly on a single GPU job. In order to run correctly in a multi-GPU job the placement of the different processes on different GPUs will need to be handled correctly.
