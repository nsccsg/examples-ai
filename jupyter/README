Jupyter Notebooks

It is possible to run a Jupyter notebook inside a Docker container.
However there is no direct network access to compute nodes from outside NSCC

There are two methods that you can use
1. ssh port forwarding
2. reverse proxy 

Using reverse proxies is a security risk and not recommended.
The user is responsible for any data loss or unauthorized access caused by use of proxies.

The safer method is to use ssh port forwarding to connect a port on your local machine through an ssh tunnel.
On local machine create an ssh tunnel to the port on the node where job is running, e.g. dgx4106:
   ssh -fN -L8888:dgx4106:8888 aspire.nscc.sg
Then go to http://localhost:8888 in a browser on your local machine and use the token to authenticate.
