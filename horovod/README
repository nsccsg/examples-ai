Horovod multinode training

This directory contains examples of Horovod performing:
  Multi-node training using Singularity.
  Single-node (multi-GPU) training using Singularity.
  Single-node (multi-GPU) training using Docker.

Performing multi-node training with Docker is more complex and requires special configuration.

For single node training the mpirun command can be started inside the container.

For multi-node training the mpirun command is run outside the container.
In this case the same MPI library (or a compatible one) has to be used outside the container to start the MPI application and inside the container to run the individual MPI processes.

This is referred to as "outside-in".
The alternative would be "inside-out" where the containers are started up first with sshd daemons (or equivalent) running inside them and the mpirun is started in the first container and connects over the network into the other running containers to launch the child processes.
