The first three test inputs are designed to gave the basic information required to use the DGX nodes effectively.
The rest of the examples cover more advanced topics.

The project code is either 41000001 for stakeholders or 22270170 for non-stakeholders

# copy files to a directory in project folder:
project=41000001 # or 22270170
location=/home/projects/$project/$USER/examples
cp -a /home/projects/ai/examples $location
#
# submit first basic example
cd $location/1-basic-job && \
 sed -i "s/-P 41000001/-P $project/" submit.pbs && \
 qsub submit.pbs
#
# run a training job
cd $location/2-mxnet-training && \
 sed -i "s/-P 41000001/-P $project/" train.pbs && \
 qsub train.pbs
#
# install a python package inside container
cd $location/3-pip-install && \
 sed -i "s/-P 41000001/-P $project/" pip.pbs && \
 qsub pip.pbs

The following commands checks status of your jobs:
 qstat 

The kill a job use (replace 000000.wlm01 with job id):
 qdel 000000.wlm01

Once jobs have finished check */*.o[0-9]* to see standard output and error from jobs.
Reference output is available in the directory "reference-output" in each of the test cases.

Please use the job scripts as templates for your own workflows.

You can see your home and project directories on the DGX nodes and in Docker containers, the Lustre scratch directory is accessible within Docker containers if you use "nscc-docker run --lustre".
